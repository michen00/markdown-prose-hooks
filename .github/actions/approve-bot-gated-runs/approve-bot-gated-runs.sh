  # Sweep on every poll rather than once. More than one workflow answers the
  # synchronize event a catch-up produces -- CI.yml and bot-automerge.yml both
  # do -- so the head can carry more than one gated run, and nothing in the API
  # says the set is complete. A single pass approves whatever had registered
  # while it ran and leaves the rest, which can be CI's run and every required
  # context with it. A sweep is idempotent because an approved run leaves the
  # action_required filter, so a later sweep sees only what arrived since.
  #
  # A zero has to hold across a sleep before it counts. The first zero says
  # nothing is gated at that instant, not that nothing further is coming, and
  # returning on it reports success over a head that is still gated -- the

  # listed by every sweep, so seen_file keeps it described once.
